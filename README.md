Bootstrap Portfolio
The main objective of this project was to create a portfolio completely made up of bootstrap, and seeing how it compares to coding CSS.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
Bootstrap
When using bootstrap you must add the content directory network url to your html, you can find the link needed via https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/Visual 
Studio Code(or any code editor)
You can find the coding used for the porfolio at via:   https://github.com/jessicahuynh19/BootstrapPortfolio/blob/master/index.html
or see the deployed webite via: https://jessicahuynh19.github.io/BootstrapPortfolio/

Installing
When you have accessed the repository page on GitHub, you may simply download a Zip file and extract it to a directory of your choosing. Alternatively, you may download the data directly to your device via GitBash or Terminal if you have an SSH key. More on adding an SSH key can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

To download via GitBash/Terminal, once you have a working SSH key with GitHub, create a folder you wish to download data into. Next, click on the green 'Download or Clone' button on the GitHub respoitory page. Make sure you have SSH key selected(and not HTTPS), and click on the clipboard icon. This copies the address to your clipboard. Personally, I use SSH key but if you'd rather use HTTPS here is a link that will instruct you on using HTTPS over SSH https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use

Next, navigate to the folder you wish to download the data into via GitBash or Terminal, and then simply type "git clone" followed by the SSH or the HTTPS URL. Press the enter key, and GitBash/Terminal will pull the entire repository needed.

Tips
